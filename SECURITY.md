## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

**Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please email the project maintainers with:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- The impact of the vulnerability (if known)
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations

We will acknowledge receipt as soon as possible and aim to respond within a reasonable timeframe. We appreciate your patience and your effort to disclose security issues responsibly.

After the vulnerability has been addressed, we will credit you in the fix announcement (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).
